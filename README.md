# -DVC-Pipeline-for-Efficient-Hyperparameter
 The key focus here is on *automating and tracking hyperparameter tuning experiments*. This project demonstrates how to create a reproducible DVC pipeline that not only trains a model but also systematically finds the best hyperparameters for it, ensuring peak performance.




## Key Feature: Automated Hyperparameter Tuning ðŸ”¬

Finding the optimal model settings manually is time-consuming and inefficient. This project solves that by integrating a hyperparameter tuning library (e.g., Optuna, Hyperopt) into the DVC pipeline.

* *Automation*: The pipeline automatically searches through various combinations of parameters.
* *Reproducibility*: DVC tracks the parameters, code, and data for each experiment, making results easy to reproduce.
* *Efficiency*: It quickly identifies the best-performing model configuration without manual intervention.

## MLOps Tech Stack

This project uses a combination of tools focused on experimentation and reproducibility:

* *Experimentation*: scikit-learn, pandas
* *Hyperparameter Tuning*: yaml.safe_load() ,params.yaml, n_estimators
* *Data & Pipeline Versioning*: dvc, git
* *Environment Management*: virtualenv, pip

# How to Execute This Project

Follow these steps to reproduce the pipeline and the tuning experiments.

# Step 1: Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/RsSubhamMohanty/DVC-Pipeline-for-Efficient-Hyperparameter-Tuning.git
cd DVC-Pipeline-for-Efficient-Hyperparameter-Tuning

# Step 2: Install Dependencies

# Create and activate a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 3: Reproduce the Pipeline

This command will pull the data and run the entire pipeline, including the hyperparameter search, to produce the final tuned model.
